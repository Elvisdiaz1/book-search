## Description

The purpose of this application is to have a app that allows you to make an account to have a personal saved list of books, searches books you want, and save them in your account to keep track of them. You can also delete them from your account if you choose. With this app, I learned how to create an MERN stack application.

## Installation

To install this application, you need clone the repository. To clone the repository, you go to the green button on the repository that says "< > Code". Then you can choose to copy either the https url or the ssh url if you have a ssh key. After you copy the link, then you go to your terminal on your computer and in the terminal, you change the current directory to the directory you want to place the cloned repository in and then you type "git clone" and paste the url. Finally, you hit enter and the repository will be on your machine and you can open the index.html in your browser by right clicking the html in the directory and choosing which browser to open it in. This app will also be deployed on heroku. You can view the deployed app by clicking on this link:

## Usage

To use this application, you first need to make an account. You can do this by clicking on the Login/Sign Up button on the top-right of the navbar. After you created your account, you can search for books. You can do this by going to the search bar by clicking on the "Search for books" button on the navbar and typing on the search bar for "Search for Books" and pressing "Submit Search". This will take you to a small list of books. You can save the book you want by clicking on the button "Save Book" under the books themselves. Once you saved the book, you can view your saved book(s) by clicking on the button "See Your Books" on the navbar. This will take you to your saved list of books. If you want to delete the book(s), press the delete book under the book to delete it.
